# Power BI Guided Projects  
*Date: 19 December 2024*

Welcome to my **Power BI Guided Projects** repository! This collection showcases the **Power BI dashboards** I created through a series of guided tutorials to strengthen my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and data analytics.

## Overview  
In this repository, you will find a selection of **Power BI dashboards** I developed as part of my learning journey. These dashboards span various industries, such as **Sales**, **Logistics**, **HR Analytics**, and **Road Accident Analysis**. Through these guided projects, I have gained hands-on experience in **data transformation**, **data modeling**, and **creating interactive visualizations** using **Power BI**.

## Key Learnings  
Throughout these guided projects, I learned how to:  
- Work with **multiple data sources** and integrate them using **Power Query** and **Data Models**.
- Design and build interactive dashboards that are user-friendly and visually engaging.
- Use **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create complex KPIs such as **Year-over-Year growth**, **profit margins**, and **monthly trends**.
- Implement **dynamic filtering** and **page navigation** for enhanced interactivity.
- Design **KPI banners**, **sparklines**, and **trend charts** to communicate key insights clearly.

## Skills Developed  
In these projects, I developed the following key skills:
- **Data Modeling**: Creating efficient relationships between multiple tables.
- **DAX Functions**: Applying DAX to create KPIs, measures, and custom calculations.
- **Data Transformation**: Using Power Query to clean and transform data.
- **Data Visualization**: Designing intuitive and visually appealing dashboards.
- **Interactivity**: Building interactive features such as filters, slicers, and drill-through pages.

## Future Improvements  
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Expand on the use of **advanced DAX functions** to enhance my calculations.
- Incorporate **geographical maps** and **heatmaps** to represent data in a more visually engaging way.
- Continue improving the **user experience** with **more dynamic interactions** and **additional pages**.
