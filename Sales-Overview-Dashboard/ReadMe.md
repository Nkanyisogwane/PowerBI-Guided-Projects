# Sales Overview Dashboard

## Overview  
The **Sales Overview Dashboard** tracks **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** by region across multiple years. The goal is to visualize how sales are performing in different regions and compare them to the **Previous Year (PY)**.

## Key Features  
- **Sales by Region** and **Year-over-Year (YoY)** growth comparison.
- **Monthly trend analysis** using **sparklines** for sales performance.
- **KPI comparison** between **CY** and **PY** for sales and profit.
- **Geographic visualization** of **sales by state** in the United States.

## Skills Used  
- **DAX**: Calculated **YoY growth**, **profit margins**, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Power Query**: Data transformation to clean and organize the dataset.
- **Page Navigation**: Implemented buttons for smooth navigation across different report pages.
- **Sparklines**: Used sparklines to show trends and variations over time.

## Challenges & Insights  
- Building the **YoY comparison** for each region and metric required in-depth DAX knowledge.
