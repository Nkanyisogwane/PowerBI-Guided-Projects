# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview  
The **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** tracks **total casualties**, **accidents**, and **vehicle types** involved in road accidents. The goal is to visualize the distribution of accidents and casualties across different regions, road types, and conditions.

## Key Features  
- **Total casualties** and **accidents by vehicle type**.
- **Monthly comparison** of **casualties** between current and previous years.
- **Casualties by road type** and **light condition**.
- **Map visualization** showing **casualties by location**.

## Skills Used  
- **DAX**: Used DAX to calculate the **YoY growth** in casualties and accidents.
- **Data Modeling**: Created relationships between **vehicle types** and **road conditions**.
- **Geospatial Data**: Used **map visualizations** to show accident locations.

## Challenges & Insights  
- One of the main challenges was handling **geospatial data** and ensuring accuracy when mapping accident locations.
- The project allowed me to practice creating **time-based comparisons** and **YoY growth analysis** for incident data.

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `RoadAccident.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the slicers to explore road accidents by **vehicle type**, **location**, and **road condition**.
