# Sales Dashboard

## Overview  
This project involved creating a **Sales Dashboard** to track **Revenue**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold** across different countries, brands, and models. The goal was to provide insights into sales performance, highlight top and bottom-performing products, and display key trends across countries and regions.

## Key Features  
- **Revenue by Country** and **Profit by Brand**.
- **Sum of Quantity by Model** and **Sales by City**.
- **Comparison of Current Year (CY) Sales** vs. **Previous Year (PY)**.
- **Dynamic filtering** by region, model, and country.
- **KPIs and Sparklines** to show trends in **Revenue**, **Profit**, and **Quantity**.

## Skills Used  
- **Data Modeling**: Worked with relationships between multiple tables to present dynamic data.
- **DAX**: Used DAX to calculate **Year-over-Year growth** and **Profit Margins**.
- **Power Query**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset before loading it into the data model.
- **Page Navigation**: Implemented page navigation for a more interactive user experience.

## Challenges & Insights  
- Implementing **dynamic filters** and **comparisons with previous years** helped me better understand how to display KPIs effectively.
- Overcame the challenge of handling large datasets and formatting **multi-page dashboards** for a seamless experience.

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the slicers to filter by **country**, **region**, **model**, or **brand** to explore sales performance.
